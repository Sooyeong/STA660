Explanation of variables

DEFINITIONS

Total Time (s): Total time in seconds for one 3-mile ride 

Total Time (h): Total time in hours for one 3-mile ride 

Average Speed: Average speed of the participant during a trial 

Average HR: Average heart rate of participant during trial

Average V02: Average rate of oxygen consumption

METS = Refers to the metabolic equivalent, where 1 MET is the metabolism required for sitting and represents 3.5 ml/kg/min

% of VO2 Max: VO2/VO2 max = oxygen consumption or metabolic response as a fraction of maximum oxygen consumption or maximum metabolic rate breath frequency 

RQ: Respiratory Quotient:  RQ = CO2 eliminated / O2 consumed

RPE = In sports and exercise, the rating of perceived effort that is used to measure the intensity of exercise.  On the rate of perceived effort scale, a designation of 6 represents no exertion at all, and a score of 20 represents maximal exertion. 

VT: Tidal Volume 

VE: Expiratory volume (is this right?) 

IV: Inspiratory volume

V02: Rate of oxygen consumption per unit time 

VCO2: Rate of CO2 output per unit time 

O2 Exp: Oxygen expired 

CO2 exp: CO2 expired 
VE/VO2: Ventilator equivalent for oxygen 

VE/VCO2: Ventilator equivalent for carbon dioxide

VO2/Kg: Rate of oxygen consumption per kilogram 

FeO2: Fraction of expired air that is oxygen 

FeCO2: Fraction of expired air that is carbon dioxide 

FetO2: End tidal O2 Fraction  

FetCO2: End tidal CO2 Fraction

FiO2: Fraction of inspired oxygen

FiCO2: Fraction of inspired carbon dioxide

PeO2: Relationship between inspired and expired oxygen

PeCO2: Relationship between inspired and expired carbon dioxide

PETO2: End tidal tensions of Oxygen 

PETCO2: End tidal Tensions of carbon dioxide 

HR (beats/min) = In one minute, the amount of beats that the heart creates.

EE (kc) = Energy expenditure refers to the amount of energy a person uses to partake in regular daily activities. This includes carrying out physical functions including breathing, circulating blood, or physical movement.
